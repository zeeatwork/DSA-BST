1. part a: Given the data 3,1,4,6,9,2,5,7, if you were to insert this into an
 empty binary search tree, what would the tree look like? 
 (Draw the tree, no coding needed here.)

                                        [3(Assumed Root)]
                               1                                  4
                                                           2                 6
                                                                       5           9
                                                                              7
Part B: Draw the BST with the keys - E A S Y Q U E S T I O N

                       (E)
        (A)                                       (S)
                                       (Q)                   (Y) 
                                   (T)
                                (I)    (O)
                                     (N)        


2. Remove the root
